            <li>It is the commonly used arc welding process manually carried by welder. 
            <li>It is an arc welding process in which heat for welding is produced through an electric arc set up between a flux coated electrode and the workpiece. 
            <li>The flux coating of electrode decomposes due to arc heat and serves many functions, like weld metal protection, arc stability etc. 
            <li>Inner core of the electrode supply the filler material for making a weld.

        <h2>Advantages of SMAW</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) can be carried out in any position with highest weld quality. 
            <li>SMAW is the simplest of all the arc welding processes.
            <li>This welding process finds innumerable applications, because of the availability of a wide variety of electrodes. 
            <li>Big range of metals and their alloys can be welded easily. 
            <li>The process can be very well employed for hard facing and metal resistance etc. 
            <li>Joints (e.g.between nozzles and shell in a pressure vessel) which because of their position are difficult to be welded by automatic welding machines can be easily accomplished by flux shielded metal arc welding. 
            <li>The SMAW welding equipment is portable and the cost is fairly low.
        </ol>

        <h2>Limitations of SMAW </h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Due to flux coated electrodes, the chances of slag entrapment and 	other related defects are more as compared to MIG and TIG 	welding. 
            <li>Duo to fumes and particles of slag, the arc and metal transfer is not       	very clear and thus welding control in this process is a bit 	difficult as compared to MIG welding. 
            <li>Due to limited length of each electrode and brittle flux coating on 	it, mechanization is difficult.
            <li>In welding long joints (e.g. in pressure vessels), as one electrode 	finishes, the weld is to be progressed with the next electrode. 	Unless properly cared, a defect (like slag inclusion or 	insufficient penetration) may occur at the place where welding 	is restarted with the new electrode 
            <li>The process uses stick electrodes and thus it is slower as compared 	to MIG welding. 
        </ol>

        <h2>Applications of SMAW</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Today, almost all the commonly employed metals and their alloys can be welded by this process.
            <li>Shielded metal arc welding is used both as a fabrication process and 	for maintenance and repair jobs. 
            <li>The process finds applications in
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Building and Bridge construction 
                    <li>Automotive and aircraft industry, etc. 
                    <li>Air receiver, tank, boiler and pressure vessel fabrication 
                    <li>Ship building 
                    <li>Pipes and 
                    <li>Penstock joining

        <ul>
            <li>In this welding process, a consumable bare electrode is used in combination with a flux feeder tube. 
            <li>The arc, end of the bare electrode and molten pool remain completely submerged under blanket of granular flux.
            <li>The feed of electrode and tube is automatic and the welding is homogenous in structure. 
            <li>No pressure is applied for welding purposes. 
            <li>This process is used for welding low carbon steel, bronze, nickel and other non-ferrous materials.
