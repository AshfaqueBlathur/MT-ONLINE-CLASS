                    <p class="text-left">•High pressure oxyacetylene welding equipment consists of two large steel cylinders.<br>•One which is conventionally painted black and is a long thin cylinder contains oxygen filled in at a high pressure of 125–140 kg/sq. cm.<br>•The
                        other cylinder which is painted maroon and is shorter but of slightly larger diameter contains acetylene gas dissolved in acetone at a pressure of 16–21<br>kg/sq. cm.<br>One should handle the dissolved acetylene cylinder with great
                        care as acetylene is an inflammable gas and this cylinder should be kept vertical, as far as possible. <br>•Both these cylinders are fitted with valves which are normally kept in “closed position”. <br></p>

                        before delivering it. <br>•The two gauges indicate the pressure inside the cylinder and the reduced pressure of gas after the pressure regulator stage. <br>•The gases are carried from the pressure regulator to the welding torch
                        (also called blow pipe) by means of rubber hose pipes.<br>•The pressure regulator and the hose pipe connected to oxygen cylinder are of black colour while those connected to acetylene cylinder are of maroon colour, so that there
                        is no mix up. <br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/image-2-compressed.jpg"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/image-3-compressed.jpg"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/image-4-compressed.jpg">

                        before being driven out through the orifice of the blow pipe. <br>•These orifices are of different sizes and can be screwed on to the blow pipe.<br><br></p>

                    <p><br>A gas welding operator uses the following safety apparel: <br><br>(i)Wears blue coloured goggles to protect his eyes <br><br>(ii) &nbsp;Wears a leather or canvas apron to protect his person<br><br>(iii) Wears leather gloves to
                        protect his hands. <br><br><br>•He carries metal welding rods and a supply of flux.<br><br>•He also carries a chipping hammer, a wire brush and a spark lighter.<br><br>•The procedure of lighting a flame is to open the pin valve
                        controlling the flow of acetylene gas in the welding torch and to use spark lighter to burn the gas. <br><br>•The acetylene gas burns with lot of smoke. <br><br>•The oxygen supply valve is then opened and adjusted to get the desired
                        kind of flame.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/image-5-compressed.jpg"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/image-7-compressed.jpg"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/image-6-compressed.jpg">
