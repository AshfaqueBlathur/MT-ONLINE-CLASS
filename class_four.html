    <h1 style="margin-top: 32px;">STRIKING  AN ARC</h1>
   <ul>
        <li>To strike an arc, the electrode should be shorted by touching the work.
       <li> At the moment of contact, a very heavy current starts flowing through the circuit, while voltage drops.
       <li> Now the electrode is lifted slowly so that a gap of 2–3 mm between the tip of the electrode and the work piece is maintained.
       <li> The voltage across the arc rises to about 15–20 volts and the amperage drops.
       <li> Due to heat generated in the arc, the tip of the metal electrode starts melting and the gap increases.
        <li>Unless the electrode is slowly moved towards the work at the same rate at which the tip of the electrode is melting maintaining the gap at 2–3 mm, the arc will extinguish. 
      <li>  If the gap increases too much the machine voltage will not be able to maintain the arc

    <!---Third Slide--->
    <ul>
       <li> A great amount of heat (and intense light) is generated by the arc. It not only melts the electrode tip, but also melts the work piece at the location of the arc maintaining a pool of molten metal as shown in Figure 1.

        <li>Without some manner of shielding, this metal will oxidise. The metal electrodes are therefore,  given a layer of coating throughout its length (except for about 35–40 mm at the stub end, where the metal core of electrode is exposed and held in the electrode holder).

        <li> Under the action of heat, this coating at the tip of the electrode vaporises and creates a gaseous shield around the molten metal pool and saves it from oxidation.
 
        <li>The electrode coating also contains flux (which reacts with impurities to form slag) and other ingredients which help stabilise the arc. 

        <li>As the electrode is slowly moved over the joint, the molten metal pool solidifies creating a joint. The joints produced by this process are often stronger than the parent metals being joined.

    <!---Fourth Slide--->
    <h1 style="margin-top: 32px;">HEAT AFFECTED ZONE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>In the arc welding process, a great amount of heat output takes place resulting in formation of a molten pool in the arc area. 
        <li>The heat is also conducted into the vicinity of the joint on either side. 
        <li>The temperature of the material on both sides of the weld bead may not be as high as the melting point of the metal, but, is very close to it. 
        <li>As we move away from the joint or weld bead, the metal may be heated to lesser and lesser temperature. 
        <li>As the electrode travels over the joint and moves away, the heated metal cools as quickly as it was heated. 
        <li>Thus, we can conclude, that the metal adjacent to the weld bead has been subjected to a heat treatment. 
        <li>If steel is being welded, this heating and quick cooling may result in formation of martensitic and other structures which may be prone to cracking and hardness. The area so affected by welding is called “heat affected zone”.

    <!---Fifth Slide--->
    <h1 style="margin-top: 32px;">ARC BLOW</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A difficulty associated with D.C welding is arc blow. Arc blow means that arc is deflecting from its intended path making the job of welding difficult due to shifting of arc. 
        <li>We know that when a conductor carries D.C., a magnetic field is set up whose strength is proportional to the value of the current. 
        <li>In D.C. welding, heavy currents are passing through the electrode and the magnetic fields set up deflect the arc to one side or another.
        <li>This phenomenon is called arc blow and it becomes particularly serious, when welding is being done at the start of the metal pieces or at their end. 
        <li>The ways in which arc blow may be reduced are: 1. Switch over to A.C. welding, if possible. Changing polarity of A.C. does not cause arc blow. 2. Reduce current, as practicable, 3. Use as short an arc as possible, and 4. Wrap the ground cable around the work piece several times.
