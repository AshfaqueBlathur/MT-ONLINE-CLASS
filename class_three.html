    <p>•Whenever welding is done, some extra metal may have to be added to the molten metal pool. <br>•In gas welding, the extra metal comes from filler rods, the ends of which keep getting melted. <br>•Ideally, the composition of filler rod should be identical
        with the metal of the work piece. <br>•During the process of welding, some metal may get oxidised. Flux is used to dissolve and remove these metal oxides.<br>•Flux like borax or a mixture of flourides and chlorides of sodium, potassium and lithium
        are most commonly used. <br>•The lux reacts with metallic oxides to yield slag, which being lighter floats on top of molten metal pool.<br>•After solidification, the welder removes the flux using a chipping hammer and wire brush.<br><br></p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 30px;color: rgb(108,151,193);"><br><strong>ARC WELDING</strong><br><br></h1>
        <p>•In arc welding, the source of heat is an electric arc. <br>•The temperatures reached in an electric arc may be as high as 5500°C.<br>• A spark is produced in an electric circuit carrying current, if the circuit is broken accidentally.<br>• An
            electric arc is a sustained spark created intentionally by a gap between welding electrode and the work piece. <br>•Because of larger heat output and less oxidation, the quality of weld produced by electric arc is much better than gas-weld.

        <p style="color: rgb(26,28,31);"><strong>1.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arc welding power source</span></strong><br>Either A.C. or D.C. power supply may be used for arc welding.<br>For A.C, a transformer type machine is used to supply current.<br>For A.C, an open
            circuit voltage of about 75–80 V is required. <br>The current requirement is however very heavy and the welding machine should be capable of delivering 100–300 Amperes. <br><br></p>

            <p><br>The following factors influence the selection of a power source: <br><br>•1. Type of electrodes to be used and metals to be welded <br><br>•2. Available power source (AC or DC) <br><br>•3. Required output <br><br>•4. Duty cycle <br><br>•5.
                Efficiency <br><br>•6. Initial costs and running costs <br><br>•7. Available floor space <br><br>•8. Versatility of equipment<br><br></p>
            <p><br><strong>2.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Welding cables</span></strong><br>•Welding cables are required for conduction of current from the power source through the electrode holder, the arc, the workpiece and back to the
                welding power source.<br>•These are insulated copper or aluminium cables. <br><strong>3.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Electrode&nbsp;holder </span></strong><br>•Electrode holder is used for holding the electrode manually
                and conducting current to it. <br>•These are usually matched to the size of the lead, which in turn matched to the amperage output of the arc welder. <br>•Electrode holders are available in sizes that range from 150 to 500 Amps. <br><br><br></p>

                    workpiece. <br><br>Welding electrodes are classified into following types<br><br>(1)Consumable Electrodes<br>&nbsp; (a) Bare Electrodes <br>&nbsp; (b) Coated Electrodes <br><br>(2)Non-consumable Electrodes <br>&nbsp; (a) Carbon or
                    Graphite Electrodes <br>&nbsp; (b) Tungsten Electrodes.<br><br></p>

                <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consumable electrode</span></strong><br><br>•Made of different metals and their alloys. <br>•The end of this electrode starts melting when arc is struck between the electrode and work
                    piece. <br>•Thus consumable electrode itself acts as a filler metal. <br>•Bare electrodes consist of a metal or alloy wire without any flux coating on them. <br>•Coated electrodes have flux coating which starts melting as soon as an
                    electric arc is struck. <br>•This coating on melting performs many functions like prevention of joint from atmospheric contamination, arc stabilization etc. <br><br></p>

                    welding. <br>•But practically, the electrode length goes on decreasing with the passage of time, because of oxidation and vaporization of the electrode material during welding. <br>•The materials of non consumable electrodes are usually
                    copper coated carbon or graphite, pure tungsten, thoriated or zirconiated tungsten.<br><br></p>
