            <ul>
                <li>In this process a non-consumable tungsten electrode is used with an envelope of inert shielding gas around it. 
                <li>The shielding gas protects the tungsten electrode and the molten metal weld pool from the atmospheric contamination. 
                <li>The shielding gases generally used are argon, helium or their mixtures. 
                <li>Typical tungsten inert gas welding setup is shown in Figure.
            </ul>
            <h2>Electrode materials</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The electrode material may be tungsten, or tungsten alloy (thoriated tungsten or zirconiated tungsten). 
                <li>Alloy-tungsten electrodes possess higher current carrying capacity, produce a steadier arc as compared to pure tungsten electrodes and high resistance to contamination.
            </ul>
            <h2>Electric power source</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Both AC and DC power source can be used for TIG welding. 
                <li>DC is preferred for welding of copper, copper alloys, nickel and stainless steel whereas DC reverse polarity (DCRP) or AC is used for welding aluminium, magnesium or their alloys. 
                <li>DCRP removes oxide film on magnesium and aluminium. 
            </ul>

            <h2>Inert gases</h2>
            <p>The following inert gases are generally used in TIG welding: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Argon 
                <li>Helium 
                <li>Argon-helium mixtures 
                <li>Argon-hydrogen mixtures
            </ol>
            <h2>Tig Nozzle</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The nozzle or shield size (the diameter of the opening of the shroud around the electrode) to be chosen depends on the shape of the groove to be welded as well as the required gas flow rate. 
                <li>The gas flow rate depends on the position of the weld as well as its size. 
                <li>Too high a gas consumption would give rise to turbulence of the weld metal pool and consequently porous welds. 
                <li>Because of the use of shielding gases, no fluxes are required to be used in inert gas shielded arc welding. 
                <li>However for thicker sections, it may be desirable to protect the root side of the joint by providing a flux. 
                <li>The process is generally used for welding aluminium, magnesium and stainless steel. 
            </ul>
            <h1>Gas Metal Arc Welding <span>(GMAW)</span> or Metal Inert Gas Welding <span>(MIG)</span> </h1>
            <img src="assets/img/C6I2.jpg">

            <ul>
                <li>Metal inert gas arc welding (MIG) or more appropriately called as gas metal arc welding (GMAW) utilizes a consumable electrode and hence, the term metal appears in the title. 
                <li>There are other gas shielded arc welding processes utilizing the consumable electrodes, such as flux cored arc welding (FCAW) all of which can be termed under MIG. 
                <li>Though gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) can be used to weld all types of metals, it is more suitable for thin sheets.
                <li>When thicker sheets are to be welded, the filler metal requirement makes GTAW difficult to use. In this situation, the GMAW comes handy. 
                <li>The typical setup for GMAW or MIG welding process is shown in Figure.
                <li>The consumable electrode is in the form of a wire reel which is fed at a constant rate, through the feed rollers.
                <li>The welding torch is connected to the gas supply cylinder which provides the necessary inert gas. 
                <li>The electrode and the work-piece are connected to the welding power supply. 
                <li>The power supplies are always of the constant voltage type only. 
                <li>The current from the welding machine is changed by the rate of feeding of the electrode wire. 
                <li>Normally DC arc welding machines are used for GMAW with electrode positive (DCRP). 
                <li>The DCRP increases the metal deposition rate and also provides for a stable arc and smooth electrode metal transfer. 
                <li>With DCSP, the arc becomes highly unstable and also results in a large spatter. 
                <li>But special electrodes having calcium and titanium oxide mixtures as coatings are found to be good for welding steel with DCSP. 
                <li>In the GMAW process, the filler metal is transferred from the electrode to the joint. 
                <li>Depending on the current and voltage used for a given electrode, the metal transfer is done in different ways.
